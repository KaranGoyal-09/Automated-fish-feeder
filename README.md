Automatic Fish Feeder

The Automatic Fish Feeder is a smart device that automates the feeding process for fish, providing timely and precise feeding to ensure their health and well-being. Designed for both aquarium enthusiasts and commercial aquaculture, this system integrates IoT, Arduino-based controls, and sensors to streamline feeding routines, monitor water temperature, and notify users when food is running low.
Features

  Automated Feeding: Pre-scheduled feeding intervals ensure consistent and accurate feeding, reducing overfeeding and underfeeding risks.
  Motor-Controlled Dispenser: Precisely dispenses fish feed using a motor-driven system.
  Environmental Monitoring: Monitors water temperature to maintain optimal fish living conditions.
  SMS Alerts: Sends notifications when feed levels are low, ensuring timely refills.
  IoT Connectivity: Remotely monitor and control the system through wireless connectivity.

Components

   Arduino UNO: Central control unit for feeding schedules.
   NodeMCU ESP8266: Wi-Fi module for remote access.
   RTC Module (DS3231): Maintains an accurate feeding schedule.
   Servo Motor: Controls the dispensing of food.
   Power Supply: Ensures consistent operation of the feeder.

Usage

This system is ideal for fish owners who are frequently away or managing large-scale aquaculture setups. By automating feeding and environmental monitoring, it reduces manual labor and ensures optimal fish care.
Future Improvements

  Additional Sensors: Expanding to monitor pH and other water quality parameters.
  Smart Portion Control: Adjusting feed amounts based on fish activity and health data.
